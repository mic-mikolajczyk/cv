The idea of this project was to proof that robotic human leg can be controlled intuitively by brain and muscle signal.</p> <p>The first step was to do a research about all already known solutions for that kind of problem. During this research, also important was to study the anatomy, physiology of a human lower limbs and gait biomechanics. Based on this research I have set theoretical assumptions and I derived the formula for muscle force based on the amplification of the neural signals</p> <p>Next step was to determine the design scheme based on this teorethical assumptions. With his scheme, other specific mathematical equations were possible to calculate.</p> <p>In a practical part of the project was to create a EMG detector of own design. It was necessary to collect sample data and based on this data, simulate the signal for designed algorithm. Major task on this stage was to analyze the signal and separate it from the noise. Thus, then, the prepared signal could be used as an input and evaluation of output control signal was possible.</p> <p>The final step was evaluate the whole algorithm and adjust all constant values in order to best replicate the physiological movement of the foot during gait.</p> <p>Scientific paper was prepared as a result of this project </p> <ul> <li>Scientific research</li> <li>Building own EMG signal detector based on Arduino</li> <li>Analyzing EMG signal from human gait</li> <li>Research of dynamic algorithm to mimic human gait with prosthesis based on collected data and physics of construction prototype</li> </ul> <p></p>"},{"location":"skills/","title":"Skills","text":"<ul> <li>Software development</li> <li>Software testing and QA</li> <li>Machine learning</li> <li>Computer vision</li> <li>Signal analysis</li> <li>Robot programming</li> <li>CI/CD</li> <li>Software architecture</li> <li>Control theory </li> <li>Software project management: SCRUM KANBAN</li> </ul>"},{"location":"tech_stack/","title":"Tech Stack","text":"<ul> <li>Python</li> <li>Pytest</li> <li>GIT</li> <li>Flask</li> <li>Docker</li> <li>Jenkins</li> <li>Cloud Foundry</li> <li>Linux</li> </ul>"},{"location":"trainings/","title":"Trainings","text":"<ul> <li>Agile in nutshell: Conlea</li> <li>Advanced Python: Altkom Akademia</li> <li>Contenerized apps development with Spring Boot: Altkom Akademia</li> <li>Linux administration basics: Altkom Akademia</li> <li>Machine learning with Python: ALX</li> </ul>"}]}
